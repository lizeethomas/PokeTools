For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from weather, recoil, status ailments, or spikes, but it still suffers from the Attack cut when burned, and a life orb will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, leech seed will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a jaboca berry or rowap berry will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.

moody	After each turn, one of this Pokémon's stats at random rises two stages, and another falls one stage.  If a stat is already at 6 or -6 stages, it will not be chosen to be increased or decreased, respectively.
suction-cups	This Pokémon cannot be forced out of battle by moves such as whirlwind.  dragon tail and circle throw still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the success rate while fishing is increased.
sand-stream	The weather changes to a sandstorm when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.  If multiple Pokémon with this ability, drizzle, drought, or snow warning are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of Speed, respecting trick room.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm.
wind-rider	Boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat if Tailwind takes effect or if the Pokémon is hit by a wind move. The Pokémon also takes no damage from wind moves.
poison-heal	If this Pokémon is poisoned, it will heal for 1/8 of its maximum HP after each turn rather than taking damage.  This includes bad poison.
truant	Every second turn on which this Pokémon should attempt to use a move, it will instead do nothing ("loaf around").  Loafing around interrupts moves that take multiple turns the same way paralysis, flinching, etc do.  Most such moves, for example bide or rollout, are simply cut off upon loafing around.  Attacks with a recharge turn, such as hyper beam, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as fly, do not end up being used.  Moves that are forced over multiple turns and keep going through failure, such as outrage, uproar, or any move forced by encore, keep going as usual.  If this Pokémon is confused, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.  If this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of paralysis or gravity, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.  This ability cannot be changed with worry seed, but it can be disabled with gastro acid, changed with role play, or traded away with skill swap.
wonder-guard	This Pokémon is immune to damaging moves that are not super effective against it.  Moves that inflict fixed damage, such as night shade or seismic toss, are considered super effective if their types are.  Damage not directly dealt by moves, such as damage from weather, a status ailment, or spikes, is not prevented.  This ability cannot be copied with role play or traded away with skill swap, but it can be copied with trace, disabled with gastro acid, or changed with worry seed.  This Pokémon can still use Role Play itself to lose this ability, but not Skill Swap.  If this Pokémon has a substitute, this ability will block moves as usual and any moves not blocked will react to the Substitute as usual.
normalize	This Pokémon's moves all act as if they were normal-type.  Moves that inflict typeless damage do so as usual.  Moves of variable type, such as hidden power, are affected.  They otherwise work as usual, however; weather ball, for example, is always forced to be Normal, but it still has doubled power and looks different during weather.  As thunder wave is prevented by immunities, unlike most non-damaging moves, it does not affect ghost-type Pokémon under the effect of this ability.
stall	This Pokémon moves last within its priority bracket.  Multiple Pokémon with this ability move in order of Speed amongst themselves.  The full incense and lagging tail take precedence over this ability; that is, Pokémon with these items move after Pokémon with this ability.  Pokémon with both this ability and one of these items are delayed as much as if they had only the item.  This ability works as usual during trick room: Pokémon with this ability will move in reverse order of Speed after Pokémon without it.
heavy-metal	This Pokémon has double the usual weight for its species.
pure-power	This Pokémon's Attack is doubled in battle.  This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.  This ability functions identically to huge power.
minus	This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special Attack if any friendly Pokémon has plus or minus.  This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.  If either ability is disabled by gastro acid, both lose their effect.
rough-skin	Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user takes 1/8 of its maximum HP in damage.  This ability functions identically to iron barbs.
simple	Each stage of this Pokémon's stat modifiers acts as two stages.  These doubled stages are still limited to a minimum of -6 and a maximum of 6.  This Pokémon can still accumulate less than -3 or more than 3 stages of stat modifiers, even though the extra ones have no effect after doubling.
solid-rock	This Pokémon takes 0.75× as much damage from moves that are super effective against it.  This ability functions identically to filter.
white-smoke	This Pokémon cannot have its stats lowered by other Pokémon.  This ability does not prevent any stat losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Speed cut from paralysis; nor self-inflicted stat drops, such as the Special Attack drop from overheat; nor opponent-triggered stat boosts, such as the Attack boost from swagger.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative stat modifiers through guard swap, heart swap, or power swap.  This ability functions identically to clear body in battle.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved.
toxic-boost	This Pokémon has 1.5× its Attack when poisoned.
storm-drain	All other Pokémon's single-target water-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon, if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Water moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.  If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.
forecast	During rain, strong sunlight, or hail, this Pokémon's type changes to water, fire, or ice, respectively, and its form changes to match.  This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than castform.  If the weather ends or becomes anything that does not trigger this ability, or a Pokémon with air lock or cloud nine enters battle, this Pokémon's type and form revert to their default.  If this ability is lost or disabled, this Pokémon cannot change its current type and form until it regains its ability.
color-change	Whenever this Pokémon takes damage from a move, the Pokémon's type changes to match the move.  If the Pokémon has two types, both are overridden.  The Pokémon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a substitute will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as spikes.  This ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack.  In Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves.
protean	Changes the bearer's type to match each move it uses.  The type change takes place just before the move is used.
air-lock	While this Pokémon is in battle, weather can still be in play, but will not have any of its effects.  This ability functions identically to cloud nine.
flower-gift	Friendly Pokémon have 1.5× their Attack and Special Defense during strong sunlight if any friendly Pokémon has this ability.  Unlike forecast, multitype, and zen mode, this ability is not tied to its Pokémon's form change; cherrim will switch between its forms even if it loses this ability.  As such, this ability also works if obtained by a Pokémon other than Cherrim.
flare-boost	This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special Attack when burned.
klutz	In battle, this Pokémon cannot use its held item, nor will the item have any passive effect on the battle, positive or negative.  This Pokémon also cannot use fling.  The Speed cut from the iron ball and the effort items (the macho brace, power weight, power bracer, power belt, power lens, power band, and power anklet) is unaffected.  Items that do not directly affect the battle, such as the exp share, the amulet coin, or the soothe bell, work as usual.  All held items work as usual out of battle.  Other moves that use the held item, such as natural gift and switcheroo, work as usual.
heatproof	This Pokémon takes half as much damage from fire-type moves and burns.
motor-drive	Whenever an electric-type move hits this Pokémon, its Speed rises one stage, negating any other effect on it.  This ability will not take effect if this Pokémon is immune to Electric moves.  Electric moves will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.  This effect includes non-damaging moves, i.e. thunder wave.
sharpness	Increases the power of all 'slicing' moves by 50%.
slow-start	This Pokémon's Attack and Speed are halved for five turns upon entering battle.  This ability also takes effect when acquired during battle.  If this Pokémon loses its ability before the five turns are up, its Attack and Speed return to normal; if it then regains this ability without leaving battle, its Attack and Speed are halved again, but the counter keeps counting from where it was.
bad-dreams	Opposing Pokémon take 1/8 of their maximum HP in damage after each turn while they are asleep.
multitype	If this Pokémon is holding an elemental Plate, its type and form change to match the Plate.  This Pokémon's held item, whether or not it is a Plate, cannot be taken by covet or thief, nor removed by knock off, nor traded by switcheroo or trick.  Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with sticky hold, this Pokémon cannot use fling, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.  This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than arceus.  This ability cannot be traded with skill swap, nor copied with role play or trace, nor disabled with gastro acid, nor changed with worry seed.  This Pokémon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  mold breaker cannot ignore this ability.  If a Pokémon Transforms into an Arceus with this ability, it will Transform into Arceus's default, normal-type form.  If the Transforming Pokémon is holding a Plate, this ability will then activate and change the Pokémon into the corresponding form.
victory-star	All friendly Pokémon's moves, including this Pokémon's own moves, have 1.1× their usual accuracy while this Pokémon is in battle.
zen-mode	This Pokémon switches between Standard Mode and Zen Mode after each turn depending on its HP.  Below 50% of its maximum HP, it switches to Zen Mode, and at 50% or above, it switches to Standard Mode.  This Pokémon returns to Standard Mode upon leaving battle or losing this ability.  This ability has no effect if this Pokémon is not a darmanitan.
gorilla-tactics	Boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat but only allows the use of the first selected move.
mummy	Whenever a contact move hits this Pokémon, the attacking Pokémon's ability changes to Mummy.  multitype is unaffected.  If a Pokémon with moxie knocks this Pokémon out, the former's ability will change without taking effect.
wandering-spirit	The Pokémon exchanges Abilities with a Pokémon that hits it with a move that makes direct contact.
defeatist	This Pokémon's Attack and Special Attack are halved when it has half its HP or less.
illusion	This Pokémon, upon being sent out, appears to have the species, nickname, and Poké Ball of the last Pokémon in the party that is able to battle.  This illusion breaks upon being hit by a damaging move.  Other damage, e.g. from weather or spikes, does not break the illusion, nor does damage done to a substitute.  If the party order becomes temporarily shuffled around as Pokémon are switched out in battle, this ability chooses the last Pokémon according to that shuffled order.
iron-barbs	Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user takes 1/8 of its maximum HP in damage.  This ability functions identically to rough skin.
mimicry	Changes the Pokémon’s type depending on the terrain.
turboblaze	This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.  For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.  When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.  This ability functions identically to mold breaker and teravolt.
teravolt	This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.  For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.  When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.  This ability functions identically to mold breaker and turboblaze.
